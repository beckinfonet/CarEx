### 📋 v1.2 Notifications (Phases 12-14) — IN PLANNING

Design spec: [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-06-notifications-system-design.md](../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-06-notifications-system-design.md). Research: [.planning/research/v1.2/SUMMARY.md](research/v1.2/SUMMARY.md). Phase numbering continues from v1.1 (which ended at Phase 11).

- [x] **Phase 12: Notification Domain + In-App Center (pure REST, zero native)** — 3-model domain, after-commit emit hooks with guards, subscriptions (Saved Search + Watch), in-app feed/bell, preferences, server-side i18n. `fcm.send` is a no-op stub; the in-app center is fully usable standalone (the denied-permission fallback). (completed 2026-06-07)
- [ ] **Phase 13: FCM Push Transport (native)** — iOS Podfile static-frameworks gate spike (first, rollback-checkpointed, real-device Release archive), RNFB 24.x install, APNs config, firebase-admin send loop, device-token lifecycle, 3-state handling, contextual permission prompt, cold-start deep-link.
- [ ] **Phase 14: Daily Digest & Scheduling** — in-process `node-cron` digest worker, atomic per-user flush, fixed Asia/Bishkek morning hour, 90-day prune. Enables the daily-cadence selector shipped disabled in Phase 12.

## Phase Details

### Phase 12: Notification Domain + In-App Center
**Goal**: Buyers can subscribe to inventory (Saved Search) and watch specific cars, then see relevant events in an in-app notification center — entirely over REST, with zero native code, so the center works standalone as the eventual denied-push fallback.
**Depends on**: Phase 11 (reuses v1.1 hide-hook, base64 `{createdAt,_id}` cursor, ModerationService split precedent, `firebase-admin` already installed for later send creds, `confirmBooking` TOCTOU pattern).
**Requirements**: NDOM-01..06, NSUB-01..04, NCEN-01..06, NPRF-01..05, NPRF-07, NI18N-01..03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A buyer who taps "Notify me about new matches" from filtered results gets a Saved Search; when a *new* matching active listing is created, exactly one in-app notification appears in their feed (deep-linkable to results), and broad searches can be switched to daily cadence (selector present, delivery deferred to Phase 14).
  2. A buyer who Watches a car (control visually distinct from the local Favorite heart) receives instant in-app alerts for price-drop (decrease only), booked, sold, and back-available (booked→active only) — keyed on `car._id || car.id || carId`, never bare `car.id`.
  3. A seller editing their own listing's price three times produces ZERO notifications to themselves (actor-exclusion) and AT MOST ONE price-drop alert to each watcher (dedup per `(uid, carId, eventType)`); a notification is never emitted for a hidden/suspended/archived listing (emit re-reads the Car with a plain `findById` and suppresses on null).
  4. The header bell shows an accurate unread badge; opening `NotificationsScreen` shows a reverse-chronological cursor-paginated feed; tapping marks read (with "mark all read" available), and a first-time empty state guides the user — all functional with `fcm.send` as a no-op stub.
  5. A `NotificationSettingsScreen` exposes master mute + per-category toggles + subscription management (list/edit-cadence/delete); the user's language persists to `User.language` and AsyncStorage, and backend-rendered notification strings have RU/EN parity (backend parity test) with currency formatted as KGS som.
**Plans**: 10 plans (5 waves)
- [x] 12-01-PLAN.md — Backend foundation: 3 domain models + User.language/notificationPrefs + Wave-0 backend test scaffolds
- [x] 12-02-PLAN.md — Mobile Wave-0 test scaffolds (NotificationService, NotificationContext, WatchButton)
- [x] 12-03-PLAN.md — Backend domain engine: emit() 3 guards + matchSavedSearches + translations + fcm stub + schemas
- [x] 12-04-PLAN.md — Backend /api/notifications router: cursor feed, read-state, subscription CRUD (uid-scoped, IDOR-safe)
- [x] 12-05-PLAN.md — Backend server.js wiring: 6 emit trigger points + router mount + PUT users language
- [x] 12-06-PLAN.md — Mobile foundation: NotificationService + NotificationContext + nav/provider wiring + translations
- [x] 12-07-PLAN.md — LanguageContext persistence (AsyncStorage + backend write)
- [x] 12-08-PLAN.md — In-app feed: NotificationsScreen + feed item + badges + MoreMenu/BottomBar wiring
- [x] 12-09-PLAN.md — Subscription controls: WatchButton (CarDetails) + SaveSearchBar (SearchResultsV2)
- [x] 12-10-PLAN.md — NotificationSettingsScreen (mute/categories/quiet-hours/cap/lists) + ProfileScreen row
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 13: FCM Push Transport (native)
**Goal**: Buyers receive OS push notifications (lock-screen) for their instant subscriptions when the app is closed, delivered via FCM, with taps routing to the correct screen from any app state — gated behind a proven iOS native-build spike.
**Depends on**: Phase 12 (the emit pipeline, Notification rows, `User.language`, and the `fcm.send` stub it replaces).
**Requirements**: NPUSH-01..08, NPRF-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The FIRST task — a timeboxed iOS Podfile `use_frameworks! :linkage => :static` spike — produces a Release archive that BUILDS AND RUNS on a real device with the existing Stripe + fmt/C++17 post-install hooks intact and Stripe checkout still working; a pre-frameworks rollback checkpoint is committed before the switch, and the notifee-fallback decision is recorded inside the spike. (This gates the rest of the phase.)
  2. After RNFB 24.x install (app+messaging locked-step), iOS target ≥15, Android google-services + `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` + default channel, and the APNs `.p8` uploaded to Firebase, a real device receives a push for an instant saved-search/Watch event with a generic PII-safe body (no lock-screen detail leakage).
  3. A push tap from the QUIT (cold-start) state opens the correct car detail on a real device — `setBackgroundMessageHandler` is registered at the top of `index.js`, `getInitialNotification()` is handled, and `data.deeplink` (built server-side with `car._id || car.id || carId`) routes through the existing `linking` config; foreground and background taps work too.
  4. Device tokens register on login/signup, refresh on `onTokenRefresh`, and unregister on logout (token captured before the idToken ref clears); the backend send loop (firebase-admin, cached OAuth, exponential backoff on 429) prunes `UNREGISTERED`/`INVALID_ARGUMENT` tokens and never aborts the whole fan-out on one bad token.
  5. Push permission is NEVER requested on launch — only contextually on first Watch/Save-search, preceded by a soft in-app pre-prompt with a "Not now" option; if the user denies OS push, the Phase-12 in-app center remains fully functional with no dead-end; send-time re-checks the hide-hook/moderation status (TOCTOU).
**Plans**: 5 plans (4 waves)
- [ ] 13-01-PLAN.md — iOS static-frameworks gating spike (rollback checkpoint, real-device Release archive, Stripe-intact, notifee decision) — NPUSH-01
- [ ] 13-02-PLAN.md — Backend: firebase-admin send loop + device-token routes + generic PII-safe push copy + Wave-0 tests (sibling repo) — NPUSH-05/08, NPUSH-04
- [x] 13-03-PLAN.md — RNFB 24.1.0 install + Android google-services/POST_NOTIFICATIONS/channel + APNs .p8 (human console) — NPUSH-02/03 (2026-06-07; device-delivery verify deferred to 13-04/UAT)
- [ ] 13-04-PLAN.md — Mobile transport: PushService + AuthContext token lifecycle + index.js background handler + App.tsx 3-state routing — NPUSH-04/06/07
- [ ] 13-05-PLAN.md — Permission pre-prompt (fire-once) + denied-recovery on settings + RU/EN copy + real-device HUMAN-UAT — NPRF-06
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 14: Daily Digest & Scheduling
**Goal**: Buyers with daily-cadence saved searches (plus daily-cap overflow and quiet-hours-queued items) receive one localized morning digest push per day, delivered crash-safely by an in-process scheduled worker.
**Depends on**: Phase 13 (uses its `fcm.js` send path) and Phase 12 (the `digestPending` flag, cadence selector, daily cap, quiet-hours plumbing).
**Requirements**: NDIG-01..05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. An in-process `node-cron` job runs inside the Express service, gated by `require.main === module` so the test suite never starts it, and fires at a fixed Asia/Bishkek morning hour (no per-user timezone field exists).
  2. A user with three daily-cadence matches plus two daily-cap-overflow items receives exactly ONE localized push (`digest_title {count}`) the next morning — daily saved searches, instant-cap overflow, and quiet-hours-queued items are all delivered together.
  3. A simulated crash mid-run causes neither a double-send nor a drop: the digest snapshots `createdAt <= runStart`, claims, sends, and clears only the successfully-sent ids (`digestPending` cleared per-id).
  4. The same cron run prunes dead device tokens and notifications older than 90 days (satisfying NDOM-06's retention policy), and the digest flush re-checks the hide-hook so a listing hidden overnight is not pushed.
**Plans**: TBD
