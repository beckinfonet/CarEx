# Roadmap: CarEx — Admin Moderation Milestone

## Overview

Six phases deliver admin moderation over approved users on an existing React Native + Node/Express + MongoDB marketplace. The sequence is strictly **backend-first**: schema + auth baseline lands before any moderation endpoint; endpoints land before enforcement; enforcement lands before mobile; mobile plumbing lands before admin UI; admin UI lands before affected-user UI. This order is forced by hard dependencies (Firebase idToken verification must precede destructive endpoints; the capability map must precede both backend enforcement and mobile feature-gating; `Order.providerSnapshot` must precede provider-profile delete; ModerationService must precede admin screens; backend 403 responses must exist before the mobile 403 interceptor has anything to catch). The backend repo (`backend-services/carEx-services`) is modified in phases 1–3; the mobile repo (`carEx`) is modified in phases 4–6. Phase 6 is the merge gate — it includes the 10k-user load test and the security review that must pass before anything ships to `main`.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Schema + Security Baseline (Backend)
**Goal**: Backend can verify admin callers cryptographically and has the data shape required to store moderation state, audit entries, and deletion-safe order snapshots
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Scope**: Backend only (`backend-services/carEx-services`)
**Requirements**: SEC-01, SEC-02, DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-03, DATA-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `curl -X POST /api/admin/moderation/ping` (or any admin route protected by the new middleware) with no `Authorization: Bearer` header returns `401`; with a valid admin idToken returns the route's success response
  2. `db.users.findOne(...)` on any existing user shows a `moderationStatus` subdoc with `state: 'active'` (migration backfilled successfully)
  3. `db.orders.findOne(...)` on any existing order shows a populated `providerSnapshot` field (migration backfilled successfully)
  4. Attempting `ModerationAction.updateOne(...)` or `ModerationAction.deleteOne(...)` in a unit test throws "ModerationAction is append-only"
  5. `import { STATUS_POLICY } from 'moderation/capabilities'` resolves to the capability map and every severity state has an entry with the full capability set
**Plans**: 6 plans
  - [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Backend modularization skeleton: extract User/AdminUser models, create append-only ModerationAction, install Jest+supertest+mongodb-memory-server (DATA-02)
  - [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Add User.moderationStatus subdoc + indexes + defaults (DATA-01)
  - [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Extend ServiceOrder.providerSnapshot with email/firstName/lastName/providerRole/snapshotAt + populate at order creation (DATA-03)
  - [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — Capability map src/moderation/capabilities.js with STATUS_POLICY + resolveRestrictedFeatures helper (DATA-04)
  - [x] 01-05-PLAN.md — firebase-admin init + verifyIdToken + requireAdmin middlewares + GET /api/admin/moderation/ping (SEC-01, SEC-02)
  - [x] 01-06-PLAN.md — scripts/migrate-moderation.js backfill + ensureBaseline startup check (DATA-01, DATA-03)

### Phase 2: Admin Moderation Endpoints (Backend)
**Goal**: Admins can suspend, unsuspend, revoke role, delete provider profile, and edit provider profile via rate-limited HTTP endpoints, each writing an audit row atomically
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Scope**: Backend only (`backend-services/carEx-services`)
**Requirements**: SEC-03, SEC-04, ADMIN-01, ADMIN-02, ADMIN-03, ADMIN-04, ADMIN-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `POST /api/admin/moderation/:targetUid { action: 'suspend', severity, reasonCategory, note }` updates `user.moderationStatus` and appends a `ModerationAction` row inside a single Mongoose transaction; `PATCH /api/admin/moderation/:targetUid/unsuspend` returns user to `active` and appends a new audit row (originals never mutated)
  2. `POST /api/admin/moderation/:targetUid { action: 'revoke_role', role }` strips the role from the user while the corresponding provider profile document remains in the database (preserved for historical lookups but not surfaced in provider-facing queries)
  3. `DELETE /api/admin/moderation/:targetUid/provider-profile` hard-deletes the broker/logistics profile document; a pre-existing order owned by that provider still resolves to the provider's name via `order.providerSnapshot` (no 500s, no dangling joins)
  4. `POST /api/admin/moderation/:targetUid/edit-profile` applies provided field changes and writes an audit row with action `edit_profile` containing the `fieldDiff`; unchanged fields are untouched
  5. An admin calling any moderation endpoint against their own UID returns `400 cannot_moderate_self`; suspending/revoking the last active admin returns `400 last_admin_protected`; issuing more than 30 moderation actions in 15 minutes from one admin returns `429`
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 3: Backend Enforcement (Backend)
**Goal**: Non-active users are blocked from all write endpoints server-side, their listings disappear from public queries without any denormalized flag mutation, and payment confirmation re-verifies provider status inside its transaction
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Scope**: Backend only (`backend-services/carEx-services`)
**Requirements**: ENF-01, ENF-02, ENF-03, ENF-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. After suspending user X with a `blocked_with_review` severity, every subsequent request from X to `POST /api/cars`, `POST /api/orders`, `POST /api/payments/create-payment-intent`, `PUT /api/brokers/:uid`, `PUT /api/logistics/:uid`, or contact-seller returns `403 { error: 'account_suspended', status, reasonCategory, note }`
  2. After suspending user X, `GET /api/cars` (public browse) no longer returns cars owned by X; after unsuspending X, `GET /api/cars` returns X's cars again immediately with no data migration or backfill — and X's cars still have whatever `active` flag X originally set
  3. A concurrent test where admin suspends seller Y during the window between `create-payment-intent` and `confirm-booking` causes `confirm-booking` to return `provider_suspended`, the PaymentIntent is cancelled/refunded, and no order is created
  4. A feature-limited user whose capability map blocks `create_listing` receives `403 { error: 'account_suspended' }` on `POST /api/cars` but receives `200` on read endpoints they are permitted to call
**Plans**: 6 plans
  - [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Extract Car/Broker/LogisticsPartner models to src/models/ with co-located pre(/^find/) hide hooks (ENF-02)
  - [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Create attachAuthIfPresent + requireNotSuspended factory middleware (ENF-01, ENF-04)
  - [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Wire middleware on 5 ROADMAP-named routes + replace inline schemas with requires in server.js (ENF-01, ENF-02, ENF-04)
  - [x] 03-04-PLAN.md — Rewrite confirm-booking as transactional service with refund-first-throw-second + providerSnapshot absorption (ENF-03)
  - [x] 03-05-PLAN.md — Replace POST /api/orders handler body with 410 Gone (ENF-03)
  - [x] 03-06-PLAN.md — Enforcement test suite under __tests__/enforcement/ mapping to ROADMAP Success Criteria #1-4 (ENF-01..04 verification)

### Phase 4: Mobile Plumbing (Mobile)
**Goal**: Mobile has a separate ModerationService (not glued onto AuthService), a shared axios instance with idToken and 403 interceptors, and a refresh-on-foreground handler so suspensions propagate without an app restart
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Scope**: Mobile only (`carEx`)
**Requirements**: MOB-01, MOB-02, MOB-03, MOB-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `src/services/moderation/ModerationService.ts` exists as a new module and owns every moderation HTTP call; `src/services/AuthService.ts` has no methods added to it during this milestone (grep confirms)
  2. `src/services/http/client.ts` exports a shared axios instance used by both `AuthService` and `ModerationService`; both a request interceptor (attaches `Authorization: Bearer <idToken>`) and a response interceptor (catches `403 account_suspended`) are wired to that single instance
  3. When the backend returns `403 account_suspended` to any API call, the client interceptor calls `AuthContext.refreshUser()` and the updated `user.moderationStatus` appears in React DevTools without a user-visible navigation loop
  4. Suspending a logged-in user, backgrounding the app, and returning to foreground causes `AuthContext.refreshUser()` to fire via the `AppState` handler in `App.tsx` and `user.moderationStatus.state` transitions to the new value without an app restart
**Plans**: 7 plans
  - [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — Shared axios client + ModerationError typed error (MOB-02, MOB-03)
  - [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — ModerationService module wrapping 7 admin moderation endpoints (MOB-01)
  - [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — useAppStateRefresh hook (MOB-04)
  - [x] 04-04-PLAN.md — AuthContext enrichment: dedupe + cooldown + listener registration + skip flag (MOB-03, MOB-04)
  - [x] 04-05-PLAN.md — Migrate AuthService backend calls to shared apiClient; Identity Toolkit stays on axios (MOB-02, MOB-01)
  - [x] 04-06-PLAN.md — Mount AppStateRefreshEffect inside AuthProvider in App.tsx (MOB-04)
  - [x] 04-07-PLAN.md — End-to-end integration tests mapped to 4 ROADMAP success criteria (MOB-01..04 verification)

### Phase 5: Admin Moderation UI (Mobile)
**Goal**: Admins can moderate users from the mobile app with per-row quick actions on the existing screen and deep search / history / unsuspend on a new dedicated screen
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Scope**: Mobile only (`carEx`)
**Requirements**: UI-01, UI-02, UI-03, UI-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. On `AdminManagementScreen`, every approved user row has a quick-action menu (Suspend / Unsuspend / Revoke role / Delete profile / Edit profile); tapping an action opens a modal with severity picker (for suspend), preset reason picker (Spam / Policy violation / Fraud / Other), and optional note; confirm fires the corresponding `ModerationService` call and the row updates optimistically
  2. `AdminModerationScreen` is reachable from navigation and supports searching users by email substring or Firebase UID prefix, filtering by role and moderation state, and paginated results
  3. Opening a user from `AdminModerationScreen` shows a detail panel with full moderation history (every `ModerationAction` row for that user, most recent first) displaying action type, severity, admin who acted, timestamp, reason category, and note
  4. The moderation history view has an Unsuspend button that, when tapped on a suspended user, calls `ModerationService.unsuspend`, appends a new audit entry to history (the prior rows are unchanged), and the user's current state transitions to `active`
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

### Phase 6: Affected-User UX + Security Review (Both)
**Goal**: Moderated users see a severity-aware in-app banner with reason and appeal path, restricted screens render a FeatureGateOverlay, all new strings are translated RU+EN, the admin search endpoints pass a 10k-user load test, and the security review signs off before merge
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Scope**: Primarily mobile (`carEx`); backend for load test / security review; cross-cutting translation audit
**Requirements**: AFF-01, AFF-02, AFF-03, AFF-04, QUAL-01, QUAL-02, QUAL-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When `user.moderationStatus.state !== 'active'`, a non-dismissable `UserStatusBanner` renders above the navigator on every screen; the banner copy changes by severity (resolvable instructions for `feature_limited`, appeal message for `blocked_with_review`, permanent-ban message for `permanently_banned`) and displays the admin-selected preset reason category plus the optional note verbatim
  2. For `blocked_with_review` severity, the banner's "Contact support" CTA opens a `mailto:support@carexmarket.com` prefilled with the user's UID and reason category; for `permanently_banned` no appeal CTA is rendered
  3. For `feature_limited` severity, screens blocked by the capability map (e.g., `SellCarScreen`, `ServiceCartScreen`, `ServiceApplicationScreen`, contact-seller CTA on `CarDetailsScreen`) render `FeatureGateOverlay` explaining what to do to resolve, while buyer screens remain fully usable when only a provider role is gated
  4. Every new user-facing string introduced across phases 5 and 6 (admin labels, banner copy, overlay copy, reason categories, severity messages) has both RU and EN keys in `src/constants/translations.ts`; grep finds no untranslated literal strings in new moderation components
  5. Backend load test with 10,000 seeded users shows admin search + moderation history endpoints respond < 200ms P95 with `explain()` confirming index use on `moderationStatus.state`, `ModerationAction.targetUid+createdAt`, and `ModerationAction.adminUid+createdAt`
  6. Security review sign-off confirms (a) `verifyIdToken` runs on every admin route, (b) no `callerUid` body param is trusted for authorization on any new route, (c) suspend and confirm-booking mutations are transactional, (d) the `ModerationAction` collection rejects updates and deletes at the application layer, (e) no new hardcoded secrets were introduced
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes
